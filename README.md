## üöÄ Quick Start

There are several ways of editing your application.


**Use your preferred IDE**

You can work locally using your preferred IDE and push changes to the repository.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

This will automatically:
- Check prerequisites (Node.js, Python, AWS CLI)
- Install all dependencies
- Set up the backend and frontend
- Start both servers
- Open the application in your browser

### Manual Setup
If you prefer manual setup, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
